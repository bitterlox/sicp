question:
>  Show that the golden ratio ϕ (Section 1.2.2)
>  is a fixed point of the transformation x -> 1 + 1/x

the golden ratio statifies the equation:

ϕ^2 = ϕ + 1

from this we can derive the transformation the ex requires us to:

>    ϕ^2 = ϕ + 1
> =  ϕ * ϕ = ϕ + 1 =   
> =  (ϕ * ϕ) / ϕ = (ϕ + 1) / ϕ =   
> =  ϕ = 1 + 1/ϕ

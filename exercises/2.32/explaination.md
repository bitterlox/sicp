the sets of all subsets of a given set (the cartesian product of a set by iself?)
is the union to the set of all subsets of a given set minus the first element and
the set of all subsets of the set with the first element re-inserted.

i got this almost on my own but inside the lambda i was using `list` instead of cons
and the result was wierd.

# explanation

a. p is applied 5 times, because the step of dividing the angle by 3 until it
is < 0.1 is executed 5 times

b. i'm thinking that since this is a linearly recursive process both the space
and number of steps are O(n)

actually, i am wrong; solution: https://sicp-solutions.net/post/sicp-solution-exercise-1-15/

i did have right intuition about the thing being divided by three tho; need
to know more math

a. we can't include numer? and variable? in our data-directed approach because the table is centered around
   the `types`, whicha are algebraic operations, and the operation which we render generic, which is deriv
   the two predicates aren't algebraic operators, so they don't fit in this paradigm

d. just need to swap the order of arguments in the get and put fn calls.

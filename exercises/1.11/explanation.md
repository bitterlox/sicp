# explanation

the iterative one i half looked it online, not the full code but the
explanation, i then easily coded it; i did have a right intuition that i
needed three state variables and i was sort of arriving at the conclusion
i needed to start from the bottom, but i didn't think i that i could
initialize the three variables to the values of f(n-1) f(n-2) and f(n-2) for
when n is = 3, which are easily known from the function definition.

# Example: Counting change

It takes only a bit of cleverness to come up with the iterative Fibonacci
algorithm. In contrast, consider the following problem: How many dif-
ferent ways can we make change of $1.00, given half-dollars, quarters,
dimes, nickels, and pennies? More generally, can we write a procedure
to compute the number of ways to change any given amount of money?
